## üíª Installation (MacOS)
  
**0. (Optional) Install a nerdfont**  
This program relies on the 0xProto Nerd Font for its icons (although the program works just fine without the font of course).  
[Install this font and set it as your terminal font](https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads)  
  
**1. Download the latest release of stim**  
``` bash
curl -L https://github.com/simon-danielsson/stim/releases/latest/download/stim -o ~/.local/bin/stim
```
  
**2. Make it executable**  
``` bash
chmod +x ~/.local/bin/stim
```
  
**3. Launch stim for the first time to create a "stim-library" directory in your home (~/) folder**  
``` bash
stim
```
  
**4. Add all your music to the "stim-library" directory (be sure that the music files contain the necessary metadata)**

**5. Learn the controls and listen to some music!**

## üöÄ Controls
**Playback**  
  
```
[ = Decrease volume.
] = Increase volume.

{ = Go to the previous track in the queue.
} = Go to the next track in the queue.

[Space] = Play/pause current track.
```

**Queue**  
  
```
If inside the "Albums" or "Tracks" pane:
[a] = Add selected album/track to the back of the queue.
[A] = Add selected album/track to the front of the queue.

If inside the "Queue" pane: 
[a] = Remove selected track from the queue.
[A] = Move selected track to the front of the queue.

[t] = Add all tracks currently visible in the tracks panel to the queue at once.

[Esc] = Clear the queue (note that the queue doubles as 
        the playback history, so clearing it will also clear your history).
```

**General**  
  
```
[q] = Quit the program.

[f] = Search the contents of all the panes at once. 

[F] = Clear search.

[s] = Toggle sorting of the "Albums" and "Tracks" panes to A-Z or Z-A.

[S] = Shuffle the contents of the queue.

[c] = Rotate between different accent colors for the UI.

[x] = Favorite album or track.
[X] = Remove all favorites.

You can navigate with both the Qwerty and Workman layouts, as well as with the arrow keys.
[h], [n], [Left]  = Navigate left.
[j], [e], [Down]  = Navigate down.
[k], [o], [Up]    = Navigate up.
