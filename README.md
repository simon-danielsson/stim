## üöÄ Controls
**Playback**  
  
```
[ = Decrease volume.
] = Increase volume.

{ = Go to the previous track in the queue.
} = Go to the next track in the queue.

[Space] = Play/pause current track.
```

**Queue**  
  
```
If inside the "Albums" or "Tracks" pane:
[a] = Add selected album/track to the back of the queue.
[A] = Add selected album/track to the front of the queue.

If inside the "Queue" pane: 
[a] = Remove selected track from the queue.
[A] = Move selected track to the front of the queue.

[Esc] = Clear the queue (note that the queue doubles as 
        the playback history, so clearing it will also clear your history).
```

**General**  
  
```
[q] = Quit the program.

[f] = Search the contents of all the panes at once. 

[F] = Clear search.

Not implemented yet:
[s] = Toggle sorting of the "Albums" and "Tracks" panes to A-Z or Z-A.

Not implemented yet:
[c] = Rotate between different accent colors for the UI.

You can navigate with both the Qwerty and Workman layouts, as well as with the arrow keys.
[h], [n], [Left]  = Navigate left.
[j], [e], [Down]  = Navigate down.
[k], [o], [Up]    = Navigate up.
[l], [i], [Right] = Navigate right.
